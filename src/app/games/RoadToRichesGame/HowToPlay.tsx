      Road to Riches is an online single player gambling game with 9 levels of
      prizes. The prize gets bigger the higher you go, but beware of the mines
      along the way! Can you make it to the top for the ultimate prize?
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">How does it work?</div>
    <div className="line">
      Choose a difficulty mode (default is easy mode) and place your bet. Select
      one of the boxes from the lowest level. If you avoid the mine, you win!
      You can choose to continue on to the next level for a bigger prize, or
      cash out at any step of the way.

    <br />

    <div className="title">What are the different difficulty modes?</div>
    <div className="line">There are three difficulty modes:</div>
    <div className="line">Easy: 4 boxes, 1 mine</div>
    <div className="line">Hard: 3 boxes, 1 mine</div>
    <div className="line">Crazy: 2 boxes, 1 mine</div>
    <div className="line">
      The harder the difficulty, the higher the multiplier when you win.

    <div className="title">How do I know the game is fair?</div>
    <div className="line">
      We use Provably Fair technology to resolve all our game results. The mine
      positions are predetermined and may not be altered before or during the
      game.
