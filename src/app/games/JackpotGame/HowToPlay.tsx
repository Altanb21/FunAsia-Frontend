      Jackpot is an online multiplayer cash raffle where only one player can win
      the grand prize. Will it be your turn to win?
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">How does it work?</div>
    <div className="line">
      Buy tickets for a chance to win the grand prize. Each ticket is allocated
      a ticket number and a space on the wheel. Buy more tickets to increase
      your odds of winning. Be fast, tickets are limited!

    <div className="title">
      Does the prize money depend on how many tickets get bought?
    </div>
    <div className="line">
      No, whether only 1 ticket or all tickets are purchased, the prize money
      remains constant.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">
      How do I know what my ticket numbers and positions are?
    </div>
    <div className="line">
      Once you buy tickets, your total tickets purchased and corresponding
      ticket numbers are listed on the bottom right of the page under ‘Current
      Bets’. Tickets purchased by all players and their respective numbers can
      be viewed on the board on the left of the game screen. Tickets are
      assigned in a clockwise manner on the wheel.

    <div className="title">What is Auto bet?</div>
    <div className="line">
      Auto bet enables you to join every round even if you aren’t available to
      be at your device. To enable:
    </div>
    <div className="line">1) toggle the ‘Auto bet’ button to green</div>
    <div className="line">2) enter the number of tickets you want to buy</div>
    <div className="line">3) click ‘Buy Tickets’</div>
    <div className="line">
      The tickets will then be automatically bought for all subsequent rounds.
      To disable the feature, simply toggle the ‘Auto bet’ button back to grey.
      Auto bet will also stop if you leave the game.

      I already bought tickets, but I want to buy more. Do I need to cancel my
      tickets and buy them again?
    </div>
    <div className="line">
      No, all you need to do is enter the number of additional tickets you wish
      to buy, and click on ‘Buy Tickets’ again. Your new tickets will appear on
      both the ticket board and your own current bets list.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">Can I choose my ticket numbers?</div>
    <div className="line">
      No, tickets are assigned on a first come first serve basis.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">How do I know the game is fair?</div>
    <div className="line">
      We use Provably Fair technology in all our games to resolve game results,
      hence the result cannot be altered before or during the game to favor
      anyone.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div className="title">
      What happens if I disconnect after I have bought tickets?
    </div>
    <div className="line">
      All our bets are handled server-side, so your prize will be added to your
      balance if you are the jackpot winner even if you disconnect.
